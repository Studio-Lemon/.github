At Studio Lemon, we believe WordPress can be a joy to work with again. We’ve rethought the way modern WordPress development should feel: structured, DRY, and focused on craftsmanship. Instead of wrestling with the same old boilerplates over and over, our developers build on a solid, future-proof foundation that lets creativity and technical excellence thrive side by side.

Our backbone is a carefully designed stack built around WordPress, Timber, and our in-house product: wp-lemon. Timber brings clarity by separating logic from presentation, while wp-lemon adds a powerful layer of conventions, reusable patterns, and smart defaults. Together, they turn WordPress into a clean, predictable platform where projects can scale over time. 

We built this stack for developers who are tired of repeating themselves. No more rebuilding the same features, solving the same problems, or fighting WordPress to do things “the right way.” With wp-lemon, common challenges are already solved, best practices are baked in, and your energy goes where it matters most: designing thoughtful solutions and building great products.

If you want to focus on creating, not coping—on improving ideas instead of patching workarounds—this is the place for you. Join a team that treats WordPress as a powerful tool, not a limitation, and help us prove that with the right foundation, working with WordPress can be inspiring again.
