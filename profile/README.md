# Studio Lemon

We help companies present their brand strongly and distinctively online. From strategy and design to content creation and technical optimization, we develop websites that boost conversion and are accessible on any device. With continuous updates and support, we ensure your platform always performs and keeps pace with the latest technologies.

Since our founding, we've invested in the quality of our technology through a continuous development approach. We constantly optimize the code behind our websites and expand our WordPress library with new features and modules. This benefits all our clients. It allows us to develop websites efficiently and rapidly.

## WordPress Development at Studio Lemon
At Studio Lemon, we believe WordPress can be a joy to work with again. We’ve rethought the way modern WordPress development should feel: structured, DRY, and focused on craftsmanship. Instead of wrestling with the same old boilerplates over and over, our developers build on a solid, future-proof foundation that lets creativity and technical excellence thrive side by side.

Our backbone is a carefully designed stack built around WordPress, Timber, and our in-house product: wp-lemon. Timber brings clarity by separating logic from presentation, while wp-lemon adds a powerful layer of conventions, reusable patterns, and smart defaults. Together, they turn WordPress into a clean, predictable platform where projects can scale over time. 

We built this stack for developers who are tired of repeating themselves. No more rebuilding the same features, solving the same problems, or fighting WordPress to do things “the right way.” With wp-lemon, common challenges are already solved, best practices are baked in, and your energy goes where it matters most: designing thoughtful solutions and building great products.

Join our team that treats WordPress as a powerful tool, not a limitation, and help us prove that with the right foundation, working with WordPress can be a joy again.

## How we give back
We strongly believe in giving back to the ecosystem that we build on every day. That’s why we actively contribute to several open-source WordPress projects, including [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber), [ACF Builder](github.com/StoutLogic/acf-builder/), and the [ACF SVG iconpicker plugin](https://github.com/smithfield-studio/acf-svg-icon-picker). By contributing code, ideas, and improvements upstream, we help shape the tools we rely on and ensure they keep evolving in the right direction. For our developers, this means working not just with the WordPress community, but as part of it—having a real voice in the future of the platform and the libraries that power our stack.
